		<p>
			<strong>What is content editable?</strong>
			Content editable is an attribute that lets you manipulate the text on elements like you would a text area. With the execCommand function you are opened to a wide range of native support for rich text editing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Rich is built with extension in mind, you can create your own icons that will execute specific commands in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.execCommand">document.execCommand</a>. If you find any bugs or have any issues please report them on <a href="https://github.com/christopherrolfe198/rich/issues">github</a>.
